# Record the accessibility baseline, BEFORE any CSS change.
#
# The point is the delta. "The redesign improved accessibility" is worth nothing
# without the number it started from, and the moment the stylesheet is rewritten
# the old number is unrecoverable. So this runs the same axe spec the gate runs,
# but in BASELINE=1 mode, where the spec records its findings instead of failing
# the run, and writes a violation count per route per colour scheme.
#
# Output: docs/a11y-baseline.json. `docs/` is gitignored and local only, by the
# portfolio's publishing rules, so this file never reaches GitHub. It is a working
# note for whoever is doing the redesign, not an artifact of the repo.
#
# What breaks without it: nothing fails, which is the problem. A redesign lands,
# the axe gate goes green, and nobody can say whether the count went from 11 to 0
# or from 0 to 0 because the routes stopped rendering.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/a11y-baseline.sh [playwright args...]
# Assumes Postgres and Redis are up: docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
