/**
 * Pre-commit gate. Four checks, all mandatory, none skippable with --no-verify
 * without also skipping the others:
 *
 *   1. gitleaks protect --staged  — secret detection is deterministic work, so it
 *      is a tool, not a judgement call. A finding aborts the commit.
 *   2. env-contract.mjs           — turbo runs in strict env mode, so a variable
 *      the code reads but turbo.json does not declare is silently undefined at
 *      runtime. Free, instant, and it runs before the tests because it explains
 *      a whole class of failures the tests would only show as a symptom.
 *   3. invisible-chars.mjs        — a character you cannot see is a bug you cannot
 *      review. Same reasoning: it turns an unreadable test failure into a named
 *      line and column.
 *   4. pnpm test                  — the gate lane only (fast, no network, no DB).
 *
 * Integration and E2E are deliberately NOT here: they need Postgres, Redis and
 * browsers, and the integration lane starts two socket servers and fires twenty
 * concurrent writers at one board. Running that on every commit would make
 * committing take minutes. CI runs them.
