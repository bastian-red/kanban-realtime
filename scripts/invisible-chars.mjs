/**
 * Bans invisible characters from source, because a character you cannot see is a
 * bug you cannot review.
 *
 * This exists because of a real one. `budget-status.math.ts` built its map key as
 * a template literal with a raw U+0000 between the two fields, and both the code
 * and the comment documenting it rendered as `${categoryId} ${month}` in every
 * editor, every diff and every code review. The unit test written against what the
 * source appeared to say (`'cat_a 2026-01'`) failed four times over with
 * `expected undefined`, and the obvious next move -- "the code must be wrong" --
 * would have been wrong. The separator was deliberate; only its spelling was not.
 *
 * The rule is simple: write the escape, never the character. `\u00a0` and
 * a space are identical in every editor and every diff, and so are `\u0000` and
 * nothing at all. This turns that rule from a thing to remember into a thing the
 * commit refuses. The escape sequence `\u0000` is seven visible ASCII characters
 * and passes; the byte does not.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/invisible-chars.mjs              scan the repo
 *   node scripts/invisible-chars.mjs --self-test  run this file's own cases

 *   - C0 controls other than tab and newline. A carriage return is included: this
 *     repo is LF-only (.gitattributes), and a stray CRLF inside a shell script's
 *     shebang line is an exec format error that reads as "file not found".
 *   - The Unicode formatting characters that render as nothing or as a space:
 *     NBSP, the zero-widths, the bidi overrides (a genuine supply-chain trick --
 *     text that reads one way and compiles another), line/paragraph separators,
 *     and the BOM.
 *
 * U+00A0 earns its place twice over: it is what `Intl.NumberFormat('es-ES')` puts
 * before a currency symbol, so it lands in test expectations by copy-paste, where
 * it is indistinguishable from the space a reader assumes.
