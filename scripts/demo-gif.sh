# Build assets/demo.gif for the README from the screenshots the E2E "demo" spec
# captures.
#
# Contract with e2e/tests/demo.spec.ts: it writes one PNG per demo step into
# e2e/demo-shots/, named so that plain lexical sort is playback order -- a numeric
# prefix (01-sign-in.png, 02-board.png, ...) is what that means in practice. This
# script does not invent an order of its own; it trusts `sort`. e2e/demo-shots/ is
# gitignored (see .gitignore) because it is regenerated output, not source -- only
# the GIF this script produces from it is committed.
#
# What the demo has to show, and why it constrains this script: the product's
# claim is that a drag in one window appears in another. A single-viewport capture
# cannot show that, so demo.spec.ts screenshots TWO browser contexts stacked in
# one image. That makes the frames taller than a normal page shot and makes the
# padding step below load-bearing rather than defensive.
#
# Two tools, two different jobs, and both matter:
#   ImageMagick `convert` -- Playwright's screenshots are only guaranteed
#     identical in width (the viewport); a step with more content than another is
#     a taller full-page screenshot. ffmpeg's image2 demuxer assembles a single
#     video stream and does not accept a frame size change mid-stream, so every
#     frame is padded to the tallest frame's canvas first.
#   ffmpeg -- palette generation (`palettegen`/`paletteuse`) and the actual GIF
#     encode. A GIF is a 256-colour format; encoding UI screenshots through
#     ffmpeg's default palette (fixed, generic) bands every soft shadow and
#     gradient. A generated, image-specific palette is the difference between a
#     legible screenshot and a posterised one.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/demo-gif.sh
#     Captures the frames and builds the GIF. One command, on purpose.
#   CAPTURE=0 ./scripts/demo-gif.sh
#     Rebuild the GIF from whatever is already in e2e/demo-shots/, for tuning
#     FRAME_SECONDS or GIF_WIDTH without paying for a browser run each time.
#
# Env overrides (all optional):
#   FRAME_SECONDS   How long each screenshot holds on screen. Default 1.5.
#   GIF_WIDTH       Output width in pixels; height scales to match. Default 1000.
#   MAX_BYTES       Refuse to write a GIF larger than this. Default 8388608
#                   (8 MiB): GitHub soft-warns past 10 MiB, and a README asset
#                   that large slows every clone and every page load.
