#
# `turbo run dev` on its own does not read .env. Turbo does not load dotenv files,
# and Next.js only reads a .env inside its own package directory (apps/web/.env),
# which this monorepo does not have. Three sibling projects in this portfolio
# shipped without this wrapper and their documented `pnpm dev` started an API with
# no AUTH_SECRET, which died at boot and left every server render failing with
# ECONNREFUSED. This repo has the wrapper from its first commit.
#
# The env-loading block below is deliberately the same shape as the one in
# scripts/e2e.sh, so the repo has one idiom for this rather than two that can
# drift apart.
#
# Usage: pnpm dev   (package.json points "dev" here)
