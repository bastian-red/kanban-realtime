#
# Smoke the documented developer command: `pnpm dev`.
#
# scripts/env-contract.mjs proves the variable names are declared. It cannot
# prove they arrive. That depends on package.json pointing "dev" at
# scripts/dev.sh, on dev.sh sourcing .env, and on turbo passing every name
# through in strict mode. This boots the real `pnpm dev` and asserts the app
# serves a page built from the database and a socket that actually delivers a
# board.
#
# Why it is not folded into scripts/e2e.sh: that lane sources .env itself and
# starts the built apps directly, never touching turbo. It is a different code
# path, and in three sibling projects it stayed green for months while the
# documented `pnpm dev` was broken. A lane that cannot fail the way the README
# fails is not covering the README.
#
# The one rule that makes this check real: it supplies the child with NOTHING.
# Every name .env.example documents is stripped with `env -u` before `pnpm dev`
# starts, so the only path configuration can take is .env -> dev.sh -> turbo ->
# the process. An earlier version of this idea in a sibling project did
# `set -a; . ./.env` first, which put every value into its own environment, so
# the app was configured by the test rather than by the repo and the check passed
# with the fix reverted.
#
# Three processes here, not two, and the socket probe at the end is the part that
# is specific to this project. NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL is inlined into the
# browser bundle at build time, so getting it wrong produces a board that renders
# perfectly, answers 200 on every route, and never receives a single live update.
# Every HTTP assertion in this file would pass through that.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/dev-smoke.sh
# Assumes Postgres and Redis are up and the database is migrated and seeded:
#   docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
#   pnpm db:deploy && pnpm db:seed
set -euo pipefail

# Job control, so each background job lands in its own process group and the
# cleanup below can take down turbo *and* the next/nest children it spawned.
# Killing only the turbo PID leaves servers holding :3000, :4000 and :4100, which
# makes the next run fail for a reason unrelated to the code.

# passed here for as long as the directory happened to exist and failed on the

# & node --watch ...)`; this deletion is what makes the failure reachable from a
# developer's machine.
