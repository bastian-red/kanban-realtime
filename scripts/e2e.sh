#
# Run the E2E lane: migrate, build, reseed, boot the api, the realtime gateway and
# the web app, run Playwright, tear everything down.
#
# What it proves: the flows a person actually performs. Sign in, drag a card from
# one list to another and watch a second browser context see it move without a
# reload, do the same move with the keyboard and hear it announced, be refused as
# a viewer, watch presence chips appear and disappear. Those cross every boundary
# in the repo at once, which is the one thing no unit test does.
#
# Three servers, not two. The board's live updates come from apps/realtime, so a
# lane that started only the api and the web app would run every drag spec against
# a page whose socket never connects -- and the optimistic update would make most
# of them pass anyway, on the client's own guess rather than on the server's
# broadcast. The second browser context is what makes that impossible to fake.
#
# The reseed is part of the lane, not a prerequisite. The specs create lists, move
# cards and add members, so a second run against a used database would fail for
# reasons that have nothing to do with the code. The seed is idempotent, which is
# what makes the lane repeatable.
#
# The apps are started here rather than through `pnpm dev` or turbo on purpose:
# Playwright owns the lifecycle, the build is the production build, and turbo's
# persistent dev tasks would keep the shell alive after the suite finished. That
# also means this lane cannot see the failure scripts/dev-smoke.sh exists for,
# which is why both lanes exist.
#
# The env-loading block is deliberately the same shape as scripts/dev.sh.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/e2e.sh [playwright args...]
#   ./scripts/e2e.sh --headed
#   ./scripts/e2e.sh a11y.spec.ts
# Assumes Postgres and Redis are up: docker compose -f infra/docker-compose.yml up -d
set -euo pipefail

# Job control, so each server lands in its own process group. `pnpm exec next
# start` is a wrapper: killing the wrapper alone leaves the real server holding
# the port, and the next run then silently tests a stale build.
