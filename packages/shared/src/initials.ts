/**
 * Initials and a palette slot for a person.
 *
 * Both exist for the same reason: presence in this product is never colour alone.
 * A presence chip carries a swatch **and** two initials **and** an accessible
 * name, because the swatch on its own is meaningless to a deuteranopic reader and
 * silent to a screen reader, and because two people whose avatars differ only in
 * hue are two people you cannot tell apart at a glance on a busy board.
 *
 * Computed on the server, once, and sent in the payload rather than derived in a
 * component. Three surfaces show the same person -- the presence bar, the
 * member list, the activity feed -- and three independent derivations is three
 * chances for the same person to appear with different initials in the same
 * viewport.
 */

/**
 * Up to two initials from a display name.
 *
 * Segmented by **grapheme**, not by code unit. `name[0]` on a name beginning with
 * an astral character -- an emoji ZWJ sequence such as U+1F9D1 U+200D U+1F680, or
 * any single astral letter -- returns half a surrogate pair, which renders as
 * U+FFFD; and `.split('')` on a name with a combining accent separates the letter
 * from its diacritic. `Intl.Segmenter` is in the standard library (Node 18+) and
 * already knows all of this. Layer 1 of search-before-building.
 *
 * The code points are named rather than pasted here on purpose. A ZWJ is
 * invisible in every editor and every diff, so `scripts/invisible-chars.mjs`
 * refuses one anywhere in the source -- including in the comment explaining it.
 *
 * Two words give two initials; one word gives one. Deliberately not "first two
 * letters of a single word": "Ana" as "AN" reads as a different person's initials
 * rather than as one name, and a single letter is honest about what is known.
