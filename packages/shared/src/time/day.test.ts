/**
 * Four zones spanning the whole inhabited range: UTC-11, UTC-3 (the machine that
 * wrote this), UTC, and UTC+14. Every zone-sensitive assertion runs under all
 * four.
 *
 * This is the point of the module. A `date` column comes back from Postgres as
 * UTC midnight, and UTC midnight on the ninth is *the eighth* everywhere west of
 * Greenwich. A single `getDate()` instead of `getUTCDate()` anywhere in the due
 * path shows a card due tomorrow as due today to a reader in Santiago, with a red
 * badge and no way to tell it is wrong.
 *
 * Reading `process.env.TZ` here is also what keeps the name honest in
 * `turbo.json`: turbo runs in strict env mode, so a `TZ` it does not declare
 * never reaches this process, and `TZ=Pacific/Kiritimati pnpm test` would then
 * quietly run in the machine's own zone and pass while proving nothing. The
 * `scripts/env-contract.mjs` rule that TZ must be read by something is satisfied
 * by this file.
