/**
 * The service token: one format, one secret, three processes.
 *
 * The web app owns the browser session (Auth.js) and **mints** a short-lived
 * HS256 token per server-side call. The REST API and the Socket.io gateway both
 * **verify** it, and neither holds a session: no cookie, no session table, no
 * database round trip on the auth path. That is what lets either of them run as
 * several replicas without a shared session store, and it is why the socket
 * handshake can reuse the token the REST client already carries instead of
 * inventing a second credential.
 *
 * It lives here, under `@kan/shared/server`, because "mint" and "verify" are the
 * same fact stated twice. When the minting side and the verifying side are two
 * files in two apps, a claim added to one and not read by the other is a silent
 * hole: the token still verifies and the field is simply absent downstream. This
 * module is the only description of what a token contains.
 *
 * It is **not** exported from `@kan/shared`. The root entry point is bundled for
 * the browser, and shipping a signing function to the browser would put the
 * ability to mint a token for any user id one `AUTH_SECRET` leak away from a
 * console.
 *
 * The API's guard and the gateway's handshake both wrap `verifyServiceToken` in
 * their own rejection -- a Nest `UnauthorizedException` and a Socket.io
 * connection error respectively -- which is why this returns a result rather than
 * throwing a framework error neither of them shares.
