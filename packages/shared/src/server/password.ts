/**
 * Password hashing.
 *
 * Lives under `src/server/` and is reachable only as `@kan/shared/server`, never
 * from the package root. The web app imports `@kan/shared` for contracts, roles
 * and the due-date helpers, and that import is bundled for the browser; a root
 * export that pulled in `node:crypto` would either break the client build or,
 * worse, succeed against a polyfill and ship a password hasher to the browser.
 *
 * That subpath is also the reason `packages/config/tsconfig.node.json` sets
 * `moduleResolution: Node16` rather than the classic `Node` resolver, which
 * predates the `exports` field and cannot see a subpath at all.
 *
 * scrypt rather than bcrypt or argon2, and no dependency: it is in Node's
 * standard library, it is memory-hard, and the alternatives here are native
 * modules that have to be rebuilt for every base image. Layer 1 of
 * search-before-building -- the standard library already solves this.
