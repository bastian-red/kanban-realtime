/**
 * The session, and the one place a password is ever handled.
 *
 * The split of responsibility with `apps/api` is deliberate and worth stating,
 * because it is the reason this file is short. The API owns the user table, the
 * scrypt hash and the comparison; it exposes `POST /auth/login`, which answers
 * either a `SessionUser` or a 401. This file owns the cookie. Nothing here
 * hashes, compares or stores a credential -- it forwards one, once, and keeps the
 * answer.
 *
 * The token is a JWT rather than a database session for the same reason: a
 * database session would need this app to hold a connection to Postgres, and the
 * whole point of the service-token design is that the web tier talks to the API
 * and the gateway and to nothing else.
 *
 * `trustHost: true` because the app is only ever reached over a host it was
 * configured with (`AUTH_URL`), never behind an unknown proxy. Without it Auth.js
 * refuses to run outside Vercel and the failure is a 500 with no useful message.
 */

/**
 * How a wrong password fails.
 *
 * Auth.js turns anything thrown out of `authorize` into a generic
 * `CredentialsSignin`, so the reason never reaches the browser, which is correct:
 * "no such account" and "wrong password" are the same answer to anyone who is not
 * the account holder. Returning `null` produces exactly that.
